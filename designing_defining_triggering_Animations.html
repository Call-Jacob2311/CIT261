Subject: Designing, defining, and triggering CSS3 animations.
Description: 
- CSS3 animations allows animation of most HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash.
- An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
- You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.
- To use CSS3 animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
- Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
