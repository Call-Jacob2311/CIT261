            <b>Topic(s) for the week: 1-4</b>
            <p>Embarrassingly enough, I felt like it took me a while to grasp my situation and our expectations for the class.
               I'm the king of gentlemen that prefers to stay ahead and give myself more time to work on other thing, since the school work load is heavy this semester.
               After figuring out the group situation and <i>what</i> exactly we were suppose to be doing, I figured I would knock out four of the topics in one week (just learning we were encouraged to pass of multiple assignments at once).
               So one day I sat down and just did all four of the topics on a Tuesday in one sitting! Honestly I felt like I already had a good grasp on the topics already and it was a breeze to work on them.
               My group decided to meet up on Wednesdays at noon but I was not teaching first so i considered getting these topics under my belt as a secret weapon for later use.</p>
            <b>Something I'm grateful for:</b>
            <p>The weather! Normally it's waaaay colder here in Utah than it feels like currently. 
            It's been a high 70's so it's gooood.</p>

            <b>Topic(s) for the week: None</b>
            <p>This week was used to catch up in my classes. My database classes are kicking my butt and require a lot of time.
               I still meet up with my group and got some great ideas for some XML and local storage, Orson had some great examples.
               I will most likely start the the 5th and possible the 6th topic next week. It feels good to kinda set my once pace, gotta make sure to keep up with it!
               Final project ideas...? Kinda thinking about using databases but that would be a waste of my time, maybe a personal project after this semester.
               So yea feeling good for the week, things are going pretty good in all my classes so far. Look forward to working hard next week!
               
               </p>
            <b>Something I'm grateful for:</b>
            <p>To be honest this week it's going to be Overstack.com. I swear everytime I have a random weird question i can find an answer there.
               And if I'm going in that direction I gotta say I love w3schools as well. Turing me into a programmer yet.</p>

            <br/>
            <b>Topic(s) for the week: Five</b>
            <p>Things are already getting a little more stessful at this point of the semester, mainly my CIT 225 class that requires my constant attention like a baby.
               I hate that I have to invest so much time into something I already know I won't be doing, but hey that's just what school is.
               This week I wanted to do both topics 5 and 6 but I had to plan around just doing one since I'm so frikin busy!
               The topic I did this was local storages and session storages basically. I really liked Orson's demostrations and feel like that gave me a really good grasp at what I wanted to do.
               What I really like about local storage is that when you refresh the page, any elements you created are still there and in there own session.
               This gives me a ton of ideas how to utilize, but since I don't have a final project app in mind I definitly want it to use local storage.
               This week I spent around 5-6 hours and it felt good to still get stuff done for this class even though I'm so busy.
               </p>
            <b>Something I'm grateful for:</b>
            <p>Old roommates. Hands down. This week I had an issue with my code and I KNOW that one of my old roomies had already taken the class!
            Just called him up real fast and got what I needed! Literally like the biggest life saver ever, ahaha.</p>

            <b>Topic(s) for the week: Six</b>
            <p>Still super busy. Not suprising It is the middle of semester, and just that one frikin class man!! Remind me never to take another DB class.
               Oh, wait, don't have a choose. But yeah I mean I'm doing good, my grades are up, not in this class though I don't think I've even heard from the teacher yet.
               I'm super grateful though that everything else is going good with my other classes and studies.
               This week I worked on DOM which is by far the best topic I've worked on yet, where has this been my whole life!
               Basically you can make a Javascript object and write functions to manipulate the actual Javascript, pretty cool stuff.
               I spent a good plenty of hours just learning this topic alone and experimenting, it was a great time! 
            </p>
            <b>Something I'm grateful for:</b>
            <p>Cheese. Man I love cheese so much. The sharper the cheddar the better!</p>

            <br/>
            <b>Topic(s) for the week: 7</b>
            <p>Finally had an easy assignment in 225! Holy crap this journal is basically going to be me complaining about another class, hahaha!
               Finally got to relax, kick back, and make sure I'm caught up in everything else! Speaking of relaxing, still haven't heard back from the teacher and I feel like I submitted stuff forever ago, hopefully they're getting to him
               This was a light week and since I needed to relax I didn't spend too much time doing multiple topics and just stayed to doing just 1, which was topic 7.
               This week was basically manipulating CSS strictly using Javascript. Pretty easy stuff, having a hard time finding why anyone would want to use this or even learn it.
               The best real example I could think of was making a button that would change the text color if people prefered yellow text over black, like changing the tone of your site of something.
               
            </p>
            <b>Something I'm grateful for:</b>
            <p>Not my Cit 225 class in case you were wondering, but in a way yes, because it's so frikin hard, when there is a easy day it makes me happy!</p>

            <br/>
            <b>Topic(s) for the week: 11-13</b>
            <p>This week I feel like I haven't put as much time as I needed into this class specifcally, I like how you can choose your own days, but normally I'm more on top of things, just too much of a work load this semester!
               I feel like this whole time I've been intimidated by the last three topics, had no idea what designing, defining, and triggering all this stuff meant without custom librarys!
               Since I was intimidated I decided to just knock these topics out specifcally! Turns out they're actually all pretty easy. Basically just using webkits to make things transfrom, and animate stuff. Spent like and half and a half on each topic and I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on it know.
               I know that one of the other topics is manipulating all that stuff with Javascript, I'm sure that will be important down the line as well.
               This week was great for me because know I have a ton of ideas to work with that will help me pick a final project, which I've been struggling to get an idea on what I want to do!
               All this animations and transitions stuff is very helpful so I plan to utilize it all.
            </p>
            <b>Something I'm grateful for:</b>
            <p> My parents are the main highlight for me this week. I just wanted to spend this random moment of the week to just say that my parents are awesome and I love them!
            They've helped and supported me soooo much this semester and it's something I've really needed. Really grateful I've been blessed with the best parents.</p>

            <br/>
            <b>Topic(s) for the week: None</b>
            <p>Last week I did three of the topics to catch myself up to a very good spot in this class specifically, all my other classes are good too.. CIT 225 why are you ruining my life.
               I've spent like 6 hours this week on one bug alone, this is awful and the class's TA dropped so there is literally no help.. Honestly at this point I'm willing to lose some points and just move on with my life!
               I didn't work much in this class just because I'm at a great spot currently, finally heard from my teacher after 8 weeks and got some points in so my grade in this class is an A now!
               Yeah so I'm checking out so spend some more time banging my head against a wall...
            </p>

            <br/>
            <b>Topic(s) for the week: 10</b>
            <p>This week was not a bad week, I feel like I got a lot of things done and I'm still treading the waters!
               What I learned for this class was the video, audio and canvas tags for HTML. So it was a very easy, basic week for me.
               The topics are pretty straight forward and I learned a thing or two I didn't know so it was helpful.
               Now onto Canvas... What even is this and why would you ever need it. Basically from what I can understand it's like a poor mans photo shop and you can make images?
               Legit no idea when or where you would ever use it, still learned it to the best of my ability. 
               After looking into a second ago I think I'm going to try using it for another week when we have to use the onTouch function, just found someone who made a drawing pad using canvas!
               Excited for the holidays next week!!
            </p>
            <b>Something I'm grateful for:</b>
            <p>My grades currently. Normally I stress out a lot about grades and it doesn't help that this class starts you out at an F. But right know my lowest is a B+ and that's even with my 225 class!</p>

            <p>AAaaaannndddd thats a wrap! just finished all the topics for this class and man do I feel good! The semester is almost done and I'm a couple week ahead in this class,
               so know I can work soley on my final project! Speaking fo which I think I finally have an idea... My dad forever ago tried to get me to make him an app where he could organize his thoughts, like a virtual sticky note and board...
               I'm 90% sure I'm going to be doing this because one, it's the only idea I've had, and two, I would love to actually make this and finish it after years for my dad! I bet he forgot about it!

               Now I feel like my life is complete! haha! This week I just spent a lot of time working on my app which is called Boxize, pretty cool stuff.
               Just wanted to say that this class was pretty good, I feel like I learned quite a bit, more than I was expecting that's for sure.
